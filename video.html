<center>  <h1>Long Distance</h1> </center>

  <p>I believe most people seem to view technology in a really negative light, but as someone who is really into gaming, technology is pretty much my social life. I often use Snapchat and Discord to chat and keep in touch with the people I've met through gaming. Without these programs and apps, I wouldn't be able to share passions and interests with people that are similar to me. Even though social media is very distracting, especially Instagram, I use it to share videos and pictures with friends instead of posting them myself. There is a lot of controversy regarding the public image of people's Instagrams and you could say that people are trying too hard to convince other people that they're happy or it displays unrealistic expectations.</p>
